#' Percent cover data from Jasper Ridge Biological Preserve serpentine grassland site
#' 
#' A data set of percent cover of plant species in a plot from Jasper Ridge Biological 
#' Preserve serpentine grassland site. See Hallett et al (2014), Ecology for details.
#' Subplot 3 from block 3 from the control treatment was used. Plot size was 1 m^2.
#' Values are percents. Values occasionally sum across species to more than 100 because
#' of overlapping plant canopies.
#' 
#' @format A data frame with 28 rows and 27 columns. First column is the year of 
#' measurement, subsequent columns correspond to individual species, named in the column
#' headers.

#' a precipitation gradient. Ecology 95, 1693-1700.
