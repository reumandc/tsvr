measurement, subsequent columns correspond to individual species, named in the column
headers.

\description{
A data set of percent cover of plant species in a plot from Jasper Ridge Biological 
Preserve serpentine grassland site. See Hallett et al (2014), Ecology for details.
Subplot 3 from block 3 from the control treatment was used. Plot size was 1 m^2.
Values are percents. Values occasionally sum across species to more than 100 because
of overlapping plant canopies.
